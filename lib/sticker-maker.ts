/**
 * Turning what people send into WhatsApp stickers.
 *
 * A sticker is a 512x512 WebP. An *animated* sticker is an animated WebP — and what WhatsApp
 * calls a "GIF" is not a GIF at all, it is an mp4 with `gifPlayback` set. So the input can be a
 * JPEG, a PNG, a real GIF, or a video, and only one tool reads all of those and writes animated
 * WebP: ffmpeg with libwebp.
 *
 * The filter chain is the interesting part:
 *
 *   scale=...force_original_aspect_ratio=decrease  fit inside 512x512, never distort
 *   format=rgba                                    give pad an alpha channel to work with
 *   pad=512:512:(ow-iw)/2:(oh-ih)/2:color=#00000000  centre it on transparent, not black
 *
 * Without `format=rgba` the padding comes out opaque black, which looks like a letterboxed
 * photo rather than a sticker.

 * Strip a solid backdrop colour down to real alpha.

 * Exists for `lib/provider.ts`'s Gemini image path. Gemini's image models have no alpha-channel
 * output at all — ask for "transparent background" in plain English and it paints a literal
 * checkerboard, because that is what transparency looks like in an image editor, not what it
 * means. The documented workaround (and the one every third-party writeup of this lands on) is to
 * render on a flat colour and cut it out afterwards, so `drawImage` asks Gemini for a solid
 * magenta backdrop and hands the result here.
 *
 * `colorkey` measures each pixel's distance from `color` in RGB space and makes anything close
 * enough transparent; `blend` feathers a thin band around that boundary so an anti-aliased edge
 * does not leave a hard magenta ring. This file stays provider-agnostic on purpose — it only
 * knows "flat colour in, alpha out," never which model painted it — the same reason `FIT` above
 * does the opposite (transparent in, padded out) without knowing who is asking.
 *
 * This is a real cutout, not a disguised version of the white-card bug: the ceiling on how clean
 * it looks is how flat the model actually paints the backdrop, which varies by prompt and cannot
 * be verified without a live key — `npm run draw-check` is where that gets judged by eye.
