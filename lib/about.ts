/**
 * What the bot knows about itself.
 *
 * Without this it answers "what are you running on?" by inventing something plausible, which is
 * worse than saying nothing. Kept in code rather than in the database because it describes the
 * deployment, so it should change in the same commit the deployment does — a fact about the
 * architecture that lives in a table goes stale silently.
 *
 * What it says it can *do*, though, is built from the feature registry and the switches actually
 * set on this deployment. That half used to be prose here, and prose in a file nobody renders
 * rots: the bot would go on offering to make stickers long after the ability was gone. The
 * architecture paragraphs stay hand-written; the capability sentence is generated.
 *
 * Nothing secret belongs here. It is read out to whoever asks.
