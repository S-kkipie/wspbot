/**
 * The sticker library — one shared collection, used by every chat.
 *
 * Three things make collecting stickers harder than it sounds:
 *
 * 1. Inbound media is encrypted. The webhook carries a CDN link and a key, not usable bytes.
 * 2. Decryption gives a URL that dies after an hour, so anything kept must be re-uploaded.
 * 3. The bot cannot "see" its library at send time, so each sticker is described once on
 *    arrival and chosen later by that description.
 *
 * A sticker's identity is the sha256 of its bytes, so the same one is uploaded and described
 * exactly once no matter how often, or where, it is sent.
 *
 * The bytes are kept in the database as well as on wapi. That is what makes the library survive
 * a change of number: a new number means a new session, and nothing promises the old upload
 * URLs outlive it — but a sticker whose bytes are held here can simply be uploaded again.
